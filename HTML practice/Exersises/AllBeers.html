                    in central Copenhagen.
                    The first brew was finished on 10 November 1847,
                    and the export of Carlsberg beer began in 1868.
                    Some of the company's original logos include an elephant,
                    after which some of its lagers are named, and the swastika,
                    the use of which was discontinued in the 1930s because
                    of its association with political parties in neighboring
                    Germany.
